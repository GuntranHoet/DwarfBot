Pointy-eared leaf lovers.

So what if I like really big guns?
Just call me the drilldozer.
Infestation problem? Automated turrets mate!
I smell bacon...
I should've left my nose on the bloody Space Rig.
Slow and tough, just like me mum.
That Glyphid Dreadnought eats bullets like Karl drank beers!
I need to get my pickaxe sharpened when we get back.
When we get back, it's sandwich time.
If we survive, first round's on me.
That guy mission control, he really has a cozy job.
There's a pebble in my boot.
Sometimes I wonder if mining is all there is to life, then I punch myself in the nose.
Zip zoom!
That's cute, you guys waiting for me?
Stop your whining, are we elves or dwarves?!
:nerd: Imagine... Hey. Hey! Why don't we put guns on Molly!
:nerd: Guys! I just figured out how to make the power drills drill through minerals. Take notes before I forget! Damn, I lost it!
:nerd: The beer is working. Listen! I know how to precisely make the drop pod land at our exact position every time we call for it. This is going to make our lives so much easier. No! I lost it.
:nerd: Although gold is the most noble of the noble metals, it still forms many diverse compounds. Meaning, the oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5.
:nerd: Wow! I know everything about everything. Ask me something! Wait, wait. Oh, it passed.
:nerd: It's so simple. Bloody hell why didn't I realise this sooner. Wait, what am I talking about?
:nerd: Guys! I know where Karl is! It's so bloody obvious. Wait, no, I lost it.
:nerd: Did you know gold isn't soluble in nitric acid?
"Step aside, wimps!"
"Obstacle? More like a granite smoothie when I'm done."
"Digging is my middle name!"
"If it ain't drillable, it's probably flammable."
"Let me handle the digging!"
"I'll drill through anything!"
"Fueled up and raring to go!"
"I eat rock for breakfast!"
"Heavy duty excavation - ain't no finer thing."
"Ain't no obstacle I can't clear!"
"Drill 'em and grill 'em."
"Time to turn some aliens into thin green paste!"
"Just show me where to shoot."
"It ain't a gun if it don't weigh at least one hundred pounds!"
"Born to kill, baby!"
"Two thousand rounds of depleted uranium. Aw, yeah!"
"Pumped up and ready to kill!"
"Trigger finger is itchy again."
"I'll kill anything with more legs than two!"
"Lock and load!"
"Let's play this smart for once, huh?"
"It's all about securing the caves, you know?"
"Quotas and objectives to fulfill! Let's get 'er done, lads!"
"Infestation problems? Automated turret, mate."
"Time for a cold one once this is done."
"All in a day's work."
"Turrets and explosions...you've come to the right place."
"Cut 'em off, cut 'em down. That's the way."
"Identify targets and exterminate. That's how it's done."
"The truth is out there. So's the gold."
"Yeah, I don't so much "scout" as make this operation possible."
"Afraid of the dark? No need, you got me."
"Allow me to...illuminate the situation. Heh heh heh...!"
"Yeah, I got a grappling hook. Whatchu gonna do about it?"
"Time to light this shit up!"
"Darkness? Ain't nothin'."
"Let's move it!"
"Keep them shites off me, and I'll keep the Team alive."
"Darkness, here I come!"
