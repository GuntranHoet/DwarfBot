# DwarfBot
 A simple bot that replies to certain trigger words with dwarf quotes from Deep Rock Galactic.

# Plug-and-play
 You can host your own Discord bot when you run this on https://repl.it. It'll even take care of all the dependencies.
 
# Setup
## Create your bot
 1. Create a Python repository on https://repl.it.
 2. Replace the YOUR_TOKEN_HERE (on line 10 TOKEN = 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE') in the "main.py" file with your secret key generated by your Discord bot.
 3. Press run.

## (optional) Keep the bot running 24/7:
 1. Create an account on https://uptimerobot.com.
 2. Go to dashboard and click the "add new monitor" button.
 3. Fill in the following fields:
    * Monitor type: HTTP(s)
    * Friendly name: dwarf bot
    * URL (or IP): You can find this in the URL of the page that is created when you run your dwarf bot project.
                   I highly suggest you simply copy the URL of that preview page and paste that in this field.
                   Format example: https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.YOUR_REPL_USERNAME.repl.co
                   Practical Example: https://dwarfbot.timmyturner.repl.co
    * Leave the interval on 5 minutes.
 4. Scroll down and hit "create monitor".
 5. Run your repl project, make sure it runs correctly.
 6. You can now close the browser tabs and Uptime Robot will keep the project alive.       

# The game
 Go buy the game if you haven't already. I don't know the devs and am not affiliated with them, they just made an awesome game. Go give them some love!
